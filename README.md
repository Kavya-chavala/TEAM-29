**Project Title**

Label‑Aware Medication Reminder & Drug Information Assistant

**Problem Statement**

Patients often forget medication schedules and lack clear, reliable information about drug dosage and side effects. This project builds an AI-powered medication assistant using LLMs with RAG to retrieve verified drug information and generate structured medication reminder plans, improving safety and adherence.

**Problem Description**

This project is an AI-driven chatbot that uses LLMs + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to:

Retrieve accurate drug details from FDA/openFDA label datasets

Answer user questions about dosage, side effects, warnings, usage, etc.

Generate structured reminder schedules in JSON format

Provide safe, grounded responses based on real drug labels

Help patients manage their medications more effectively

The system demonstrates responsible AI usage in healthcare by grounding all answers in verified drug label data rather than allowing the model to hallucinate.
